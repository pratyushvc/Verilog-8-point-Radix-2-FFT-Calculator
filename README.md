# Verilog-8-point-Radix-2-FFT-Calculator
An 8-point Radix-2 FFT implementation in Verilog with fixed-point decimal support. Designed for FPGA/DSP systems, this project accurately handles real and imaginary components using custom arithmetic modules and avoids floating-point hardware. Includes a testbench for validation
